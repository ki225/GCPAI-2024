## Topics tested
Craft effective prompts and use parameters to guide generative AI output in Vertex AI Studio.
Apply Gemini models to create product descriptions and taglines in a real-world marketing scenario.
Examine and run Python code exported from Vertex AI Studio to gain a basic understanding of generative AI implementation.
Use Jupyter Notebooks to test and modify generative AI code.

## Tasks

### Task 1. Build a Gemini image analysis tool
create a template for analyzing images of Cymbal Direct products using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model in Vertex AI Studio. The goal is to generate descriptive text options inspired by the image, from simple details to more evocative, mood-setting phrases.

Use Vertex AI Studio's Freeform interface with the gemini-1.5-pro model to analyze Cymbal Direct's product image (provided) and generate multiple descriptive text options inspired by the image.


Experiment with different prompts to generate the following:

- Short, descriptive text inspired by the image.
- Catchy phrases suitable for advertisements.
- A poetic description for a nature-focused campaign.

### Task 2. Build a Gemini tagline generator



### Task 3. Experiment with image analysis code


### Task 4. Experiment with tagline generation code
