# Getting Started with the Vertex AI Gemini API and Python SDK


## Vertex AI Gemini API
The Vertex AI Gemini API provides a unified interface for interacting with Gemini models. There are currently two models available in the Gemini API:

- Gemini 1.0 Pro model (gemini-1.0-pro): Designed to handle natural language tasks, multi-turn text and code chat, and code generation.
- Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model (gemini-1.0-pro-vision): Supports multimodal prompts. You can include text, images, and video in your prompt requests and get text or code responses.

interact with the Gemini API using the following methods:

- Use the Vertex AI Studio for quick testing and command generation
- Use cURL commands
- Use the Vertex AI SDK

## Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Install the Vertex AI SDK for Python
- Use the Gemini 1.0 Pro (gemini-1.0-pro) model to generate text
- Use the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision (gemini-1.0-pro-vision) multimodal model to generate text from a combination of text, images, and video

## Task 1. Open the notebook in Vertex AI Workbench


## Task 2. Set up the notebook


## Task 3. Use the Gemini 1.0 Pro model

### Generate text from text prompts

### print history

## Task 4. Use the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model
Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision (gemini-1.0-pro-vision) is a multimodal model that supports multimodal prompts

- 
- Generate text from local image and text
- Generate text from text and image prompts
- Combining multiple images and text prompts for few-shot prompting
