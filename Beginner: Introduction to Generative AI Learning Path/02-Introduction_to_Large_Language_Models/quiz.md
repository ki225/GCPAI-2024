## What are large language models (LLMs)?

- [ ] An LLM is an advanced natural language processing framework that uses linguistic algorithms to generate sophisticated conversational agents.
- [x] An LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate human-quality text. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can be used for many tasks, such as writing, translating, and coding.
- [ ] An LLM is a state-of-the-art computer vision system that excels in recognizing and analyzing intricate patterns and features in images and videos.
- [ ] An LLM is an artificial neural network architecture optimized for training large-scale reinforcement learning agents capable of mastering complex tasks in robotics.
