### What are the two main techniques used by ScaNN (Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor) to improve search performance in vector search?
- [ ] Cosine distance and Manhattan distance
- [ ] Brute force search and approximate nearest neighbor search
- [ ] Dimensionality reduction and indexing
- [x] Space pruning and data quantization

### Which of the following is correct to compare between vector search and traditional keyword search?
- [x] Vector search addresses semantic similarity and is good at solving ambiguous queries, whereas traditional keyword search is good at solving precise queries.
- [ ] Vector search is faster than traditional keyword search.
- [ ] Vector search is limited to text, while traditional keyword search can handle multimodal data.

### What is the main purpose of using distance metrics like dot product distance in vector search?
- [ ] Search for the top three nearest neighbors of a query vector.
- [ ] Generate new vectors from existing ones.
- [ ] Index vectors efficiently in the search space.
- [x] Measure the distance between vectors in terms of semantic similarity.

### What are the two main technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to implement vector search effectively?
- [ ] Efficiency and personalization
- [ ] Hallucination and grounding
- [ ] User adoption and cost
- [x] Encoding and indexing

### What is the general process to build a search application by using Vertex AI Vector Search?
- [x] Encode data to embeddings, build an index, and search results.
- [ ] Generate tokens, deploy an index, and create a vector space.
- [ ] Generate one-hot encodings, encode data to embeddings, and create a vector space.

### What is the main benefit of using vector search in RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to address LLM (Large Language Models) hallucination?
- [ ] It improves the LLM's ability to understand and respond to complex prompts.
- [ ] It reduces the computational cost of fine-tuning the LLM.
- [ ] It eliminates the need for human review of the LLM's responses.
- [x] It allows the LLM to access real-time information for fact-checking.
