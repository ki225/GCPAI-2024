## Task 1. Create a Vertex AI Workbench Instance
### Create notebook
### Clone and run the lab notebook
clone the Google Cloud Generative AI repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai.git
```
1. In the left navigation pane, navigate to the generative-ai/embeddings folder and open the intro-textemb-vectorsearch.ipynb notebook.
2. For the prompt Select Kernel leave the default Python3 and click Select.
3. Scroll down to the Text Embeddings in Action section, and run the setup cells.
4. When setting your environment variables, use us-central1 for the location, and qwiklabs-gcp-03-accda8f055c4 for the Project ID.

## Task 2. Generate embeddings
1. Navigate to the Getting Started with Vertex AI Embeddings for Text section and run through the cells to create the text embeddings.
2. Navigate to the Getting Started with Vector Search section and run through the cells.
3. Save the embeddings in a JSON file.
4. Create a new Cloud Storage bucket and copy the file to it.


## Task 3. Create and deploy an index
1. Navigate to the Create an Index section and run through the cells to create and deploy an index.

### Explore Vector Search and try the demo
