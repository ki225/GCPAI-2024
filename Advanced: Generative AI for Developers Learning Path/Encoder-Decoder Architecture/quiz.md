### 1. What is the difference between greedy search and beam search?
- [x] Greedy search always selects the word with the highest probability, whereas beam search considers multiple possible words and selects the one with the highest combined probability.
- [ ] Greedy search considers multiple possible words and selects the one with the highest combined probability, whereas beam search always selects the word with the highest probability.
- [ ] Greedy search always selects the word with the lowest probability, whereas beam search considers multiple possible words and selects the one with the lowest combined probability.
- [ ] Greedy search considers multiple possible words and selects the one with the lowest combined probability, whereas beam search always selects the word with the lowest probability.

### 2. What is the name of the machine learning architecture that takes a sequence of words as input and outputs a sequence of words?
- [x] Encoder-decoder
- [ ] Large stream text manipulation
- [ ] Regressive neural networking
- [ ] Collaborative natural network

### 3. What are two ways to generate text from a trained encoder-decoder model at serving time?
- [ ] Teacher forcing and beam search
- [ ] Greedy search and attention
- [x] Greedy search and beam search
- [ ] Teacher forcing and attention

### 4. What is the purpose of the decoder in an encoder-decoder architecture?
- [x] To predict the next word in the output sequence
- That's correct!
- [ ] To learn the relationship between the input and output sequences
- [x] To generate the output sequence from the vector representation
- [ ] To convert the input sequence into a vector representation

### 5. What is the purpose of the encoder in an encoder-decoder architecture?
- [ ] To generate the output sequence from the vector representation
- [ ] To predict the next word in the output sequence
- [x] To convert the input sequence into a vector representation
- [ ] To learn the relationship between the input and output sequences
