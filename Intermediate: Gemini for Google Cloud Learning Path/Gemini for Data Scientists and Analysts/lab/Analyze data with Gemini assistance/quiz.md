Which Vertex AI model can be used to identify customer clusters or segments?

- [ ] Chat-bison (PaLM 2 for Chat)
- [x] K-means clustering model
- [ ] Multmodalembedding (Embeddings for Multimodal)
- [ ] Text-bison (PaLM 2 for Text)

>[!Note]
>K-means clustering is a well-established machine learning algorithm designed specifically for clustering data points into distinct groups. It's particularly effective when you have numerical data representing customer attributes (e.g., age, income, purchase history).
>
>Chat-bison, Multmodalembedding, and Text-bison are language models designed for different tasks. While they might indirectly help in understanding customer behavior or preferences, they are not directly tailored for clustering tasks.
